Crawling the web to identify the perseverance of cookie banners and respect for choice


Cookie banners are all over the web, and we face them when browsing the web especially in Europe. Recently, various browsers (such as Brave and DuckDuckGo) have picked up different approaches to opt in/out users out of cookies, and stopping the banners from showing altogether. This is partly due to research from Inria also demonstrating that companies often do not respect user choices. In this project, the student will perform a large-scale web crawl using latest crawling tools and compare the number of storage sets and the number of third party network requests with 1) no cookie banner blocking, 2) Brave method, 3) DDG and similar method.
